The grades K–8 mathematics standards are organized by grade level, with four or five domains within each level. Under each domain are overarching standard statements followed by a cluster of related standards.

For high school, the CCSS are organized by conceptual categories, which together portray a coherent view of high school mathematics and span traditional high school course boundaries. These conceptual categories include: Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Modeling, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability. Under each conceptual category there is an organizing structure similar to that used in K–8: domains with overarching standard statements, with each followed by a cluster of related standards.
