Level A focuses almost entirely on counting, cardinality, number sense, and base-ten operations. This includes developing an understanding of whole number relationships and two-digit place value, as well as strategies for (and fluency with) addition and subtraction. To provide a foundation for algebra, standards introduce the concept of an equation, a variable, and the meaning of the equal sign, all within the context of addition and subtraction within 20. In addition to number, some attention is given to describing and reasoning about geometric shapes in space as a basis for understanding the properties of congruence, similarity, and symmetry, and developing an understanding of linear measurement (length).
