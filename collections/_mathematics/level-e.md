Themes introduced and developed in earlier levels continue and deepen in Level E. Having already extended arithmetic calculations from whole numbers to fractions and from fractions to rational and irrational numbers, understanding the real number system comes to the fore. Understanding radical expressions, using and interpreting units in problem solving, and attending to precision are important areas of focus. Prior work with proportional relationships and functions expands from linear expressions, equations, and functions to quadratic, rational, exponential, and polynomial. To bridge the gap between algebra and geometry, rates and relationships are applied to density models. Work also advances in geometry, including using congruence and similarity criteria to prove relationships in geometric figures and determining volumes of cylinders, pyramids, cones, and spheres. Basic skills and knowledge of statistics and probability are applied in a modeling context, in which students interpret and compare data distributions and understand issues of correlation and causation.

Note: Making mathematical models is a Standard for Mathematical Practice (MP.4), and specific modeling standards appear throughout the high school standards indicated by an asterisk (&#42;).
