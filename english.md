The ELP Standards for AE are divided into two groups: Standards 1–7 and Standards 8–10. Standards 1–7 highlight the language skills required for ELLs to engage in content-specific practices necessary for their full engagement in English language arts and literacy, mathematics, and science. Standards 8–10 highlight the linguistic skills needed to support Standards 1–7. For example, ELP Standard 8 (*An ELL can determine the meaning of words and phrases in oral presentations and literary and informational text*) is necessary in order for ELLs to engage with ELP Standard 1 (*An ELL can construct meaning from oral presentations and literary and informational text through level-appropriate listening, reading, and viewing*).

As a whole, the ELP Standards for AE focus on all four domains of language acquisition: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. ELP Standards 1 and 8 focus on **receptive** skills (i.e., listening and reading). The focus of ELP Standards 3, 4, and 7 is on **productive** skills (i.e., speaking and writing). ELP Standards 2, 5, and 6 are **interactive** in that they require collaborative use of both receptive and productive skills. ELP Standards 9 and 10 focus on the **linguistic structures of English**.
