The Language Standards include the essential “rules” of standard written and spoken English, but they also approach language as a matter of craft and informed choice among alternatives. The vocabulary standards focus on understanding words and phrases and their nuances and relationships, and on acquiring new vocabulary, particularly general academic and domain-specific words and phrases. Students advancing through the levels are expected to meet each level’s specific standards and retain or further develop skills and understanding mastered in preceding levels.
