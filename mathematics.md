The CCSS for Mathematics have two central parts: the Standards for Mathematical Practice and the Standards for Mathematical Content.

The Standards for Mathematical Practice (the Practices)—accepted in their entirety by the panel— describe habits of mind that mathematics educators at all levels of learning should seek to develop in their students. These practices rest on “processes and proficiencies” with established significance in mathematics education, including such skills as complex problem solving, reasoning and proof, modeling, precise communication, and making connections.

The Standards for Mathematical Content are a balanced combination of procedural fluency and conceptual understanding intended to be connected to the Practices across domains and at each level. The Practices define ways students are to engage with the subject matter as they grow in mathematical maturity and expertise across levels. Content expectations that begin with the word “understand” highlight the relationship between the two parts of the CCSS for Mathematics and connect the practices and content standards.
